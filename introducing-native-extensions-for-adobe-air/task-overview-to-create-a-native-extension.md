# Task overview to create a native extension

To create a native extension, do the following tasks:

1.  Define the methods and properties of the ActionScript extension classes.

2.  Code the ActionScript extension classes.

    See
    [Coding the ActionScript side](../coding-the-actionscript-side/index.md).

3.  Code the native implementation.

    See
    [Coding the native side with C](../coding-the-native-side-with-c/index.md)
    and
    [Coding the native side with Java](../coding-the-native-side-with-java/index.md).

4.  Build the ActionScript side and the native side, create an extension
    descriptor file, and package the extension and its resources.

    See [Packaging a native extension](../packaging-a-native-extension/index.md)
    for all devices.

5.  Document the public interfaces of the ActionScript extension class.

Typically, as with any software development, working through these steps is an
iterative process.
