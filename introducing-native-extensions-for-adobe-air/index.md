# Introducing native extensions for Adobe AIR

Native Extensions for Adobe AIR are code libraries that contain native code
wrapped with an ActionScript API. You can use native extensions in an AIR
application to access platform features not supported by AIR, to benefit from
native-code-level performance for critical algorithms, and to reuse existing
native code libraries.
