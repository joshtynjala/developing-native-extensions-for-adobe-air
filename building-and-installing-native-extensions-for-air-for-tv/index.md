# Building and installing native extensions for AIR for TV

To develop native extensions for an AIR for TV device, you must have access to
the AIR for TV extensions development kit (EDK). The EDK is distributed to
device manufacturers and system-on-a-chip manufacturers who include AIR for TV
with their product.
